<p>Sometimes UX design requires the perspective of a kid, full of curiosity, to find new heights. By creating a UX sitemap, you’ll be able to take an early glance at your website or application from the tree tops. Let’s look at the what, when, how, and why of UX sitemaps.</p> <h2>What is it?</h2> <p>A UX sitemap is a hierarchical diagram of a website or application, showing how pages are prioritized, linked, and labeled. If a user flow is like the street view details, the sitemap is like the bird’s eye view.</p> <h2>When is it used?</h2> <p>Sitemaps are used early in the UX design process, right after the discovery phase. You’ll typically create a sitemap after personas, user journey, and card sorting. For an existing website, work on a site audit or content inventory before designing the new sitemap.</p> <ul> <li>Create a UX sitemap after card sorting, and before wireframing.</li> </ul> <h2>How to create a UX Sitemap</h2><h3>Anatomy</h3> <p>A UX sitemap consists of linked pages, each with a reference number and a label. Reference numbers help you keep track of pages even as you move on to wireframes, prototypes, and iterations. Write labels as clear page titles, optimized for users through card sorting.</p>

<ul> <li>Start with the homepage, and place pages in following rows by priority (high-level categories to specific pages). You’ll see primary pages in a row, secondary pages in the next, and so on.</li>

<li>Another way to look at sitemap hierarchy is through URL structure: <em>website.com/category/sub-category/specific-page</em>.</li> <li>Although optional, you can also include a legend explaining symbols and lines, annotations clarifying information, and illustrated page types to show type distribution.</li>

 <h3>Tips for Small, Medium, Large Websites</h3> <p>Depending on the size and complexity of your website, you can create a flat or deep sitemap.</p>

<ul> <li>For a small website or application (10+ pages), consider creating a flat sitemap with 4 or less vertical levels. Flat sitemaps enhance discoverability of content because there are fewer levels to click through. The flattest sitemap consists of 1 vertical level, where different sections are placed on one page.</li> <li>For medium sized websites (100+ pages), you can still create a flat sitemap but with a wider row of secondary pages. To surface those pages, consider using a mega menu that groups links into sub-categories to improve scanning.</li> <li>For large sized websites (1,000+ pages), consider creating a deep sitemap to help house all the information, with 5+ vertical levels. Deep sitemaps can make it harder to discover content, so try to provide alternative ways (like menu shortcuts) to reach deeper pages. Category pages or navigation hubs can also help further organize the volume of pages.</li> </ul> <h2>Why is it valuable?</h2> <p>A UX sitemap allows you to plan for usability, whether you’re working on a new website or a redesign. It provides a full overview, which helps teams to simplify, trim off unnecessary pages, and keep what’s important. A UX sitemap also helps you see if linked pages are user and SEO friendly. With a sitemap, you can strategically place content where users would easily find it, and also pinpoint problem areas such as pages hidden under an unintuitive label.</p>
<p>Wireframes visualize a user path or flow, page layouts, information hierarchy, and interactions. They can vary in fidelity, from quick sketches to detailed representations of the final design.</p> <p>For people with limited or no drawing abilities, wireframing can be daunting. Here are some ideas to help stakeholders get comfortable with sketching:</p><ul> <li>Messy is completely fine and expected (especially for low-fidelity wireframes).</li> <li>Use physical constraints to prevent obsessing over tiny aesthetic details:</li> <ul> <li>Thick pens or sharpies</li> <li>Time boxing</li> <li>Limited space for the sketch</li> </ul> </ul> <h2>In This Article:</h2> <ul> <li>Step-by-Step Sketching Guide</li> <li>An Example: Sketching a Product-Detail Page</li> <li>Conclusion</li> </ul> <h3>Step-by-Step Sketching Guide</h3> <p>Common components used in wireframes help focus on getting the idea right rather than on how to draw. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Identify your browser-window or device aspect ratio:</strong> <ul> <li>For web wireframes: common sizes are 1024x768 pixels and 1920x1080 pixels.</li> <li>For mobile: dimensions vary based on the specific device (e.g., tablet, various-size phones).</li>

</ul> </li> <li> <strong>Draw the navigation and search:</strong> <ul> <li>Follow an existing design or template, e.g., a navigation bar at the top.</li> <li>Indicate navigation (horizontal or vertical) with a rectangle in the corresponding position.</li> <li>Represent the search feature with a search icon and search box.</li> </ul> </li> <li>

<strong>Identify and draw the largest elements in your design:</strong> <ul><li>Headers: thicker lines</li> <li>Body text: thinner lines</li> <li>Images: rectangle with an X</li> </ul> </li> <li>
