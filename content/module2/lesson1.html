<h1>Understanding Users and Context</h1>
    <p>Designers can create a better user experience by understanding the context in which users interact with their products. For example, a user booking a flight on the go needs a different experience than one booking from a home computer.</p>
    <p>There are several ways to understand users and their context:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Research:</strong> Conducting interviews, surveys, and usability testing to understand user goals, needs, and pain points.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> Using data to see how users interact with the product, such as page visits, actions taken, and time spent on each page.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Understanding users and context helps in creating user-friendly, efficient, and enjoyable products, leading to increased satisfaction, engagement, and loyalty.</p>
    <h2>Examples of Contextual Design</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A travel agency website might display different information based on the user's location. For instance, users in the US see flights to and from the US, while users in Europe see flights related to Europe.</li>
        <li>A grocery store mobile app might offer a store layout map when users are in the store and a product list when they are not.</li>
        <li>A news website might show more political news articles to users interested in politics and more sports news to those interested in sports.</li>
    </ul>
