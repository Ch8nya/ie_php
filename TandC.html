                At InternEase, we believe in providing enriching internship opportunities that not only foster professional growth but also offer financial support to our participants. Our internship program durations range from a brief exploratory experience to an immersive, extended engagement, tailored to meet the unique requirements of each role.<br><br>

                We have structured our internship stipend payments to align with the duration and scope of the internship. Participants will receive their stipend on a weekly cadence, calculated based on a predefined monthly compensation scale.<br><br>

                While we cannot disclose specific stipend amounts due to the dynamic nature of our internship offerings, we assure our participants that they will receive fair and competitive compensation commensurate with the responsibilities and time commitment of their internship role.<br><br>

                Furthermore, we are committed to ensuring that each participant receives a minimum stipend upon successful completion of their first week, regardless of the internship duration. This initial stipend serves as a token of our appreciation for their dedication and commitment to the program.<br><br>

                By participating in our internship program, you acknowledge and agree to our stipend structure and payment terms. We encourage open communication with our team regarding any questions or concerns about the stipend or duration of your internship.<br><br>
