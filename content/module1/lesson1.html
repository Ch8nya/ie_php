<p>Design thinking is an iterative process that revolves around understanding users, challenging assumptions, redefining problems, and creating innovative solutions through prototyping and testing. The overall goal is to identify alternative strategies and solutions that may not be immediately apparent.</p>

<p>Design thinking is more than just a process; it offers a new way of thinking and a collection of hands-on methods to apply this mindset. It involves:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developing empathy with target users through observation.</li>
  <li>Questioning the problem, assumptions, and implications.</li>
  <li>Tackling ill-defined or unknown problems through ongoing experimentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The iterative and non-linear design thinking process consists of five phases:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Empathize</li>
  <li>Define</li>
  <li>Ideate</li>
  <li>Prototype</li>
  <li>Test</li>
</ol>
<p>These stages can be carried out in parallel, repeated, and revisited as necessary. The core purpose is to work dynamically to develop and launch innovative ideas.</p>
<h3>Design Thinking and Out-of-the-Box Thinking</h3>
<p>Design thinking encourages out-of-the-box thinking by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developing new ways of thinking beyond common problem-solving methods.</li>
  <li>Aiming to improve products, services, and processes.</li>
  <li>Analyzing and understanding user interactions with products.</li>
  <li>Asking significant questions and challenging assumptions.</li>
  <li>Making previous assumptions falsifiable (possible to prove valid or not).</li>
</ul>
<p>Design thinking allows digging deeper into problem-solving through research, prototyping, and testing to uncover new ways to meet users' needs.</p>
<h3>Scientific Activities in Design Thinking</h3>
<p>The scientific activities in design thinking analyze user interactions with products and investigate the conditions in which they operate. These activities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Researching users' needs.</li>
  <li>Pooling experience from previous projects.</li>
  <li>Considering present and future conditions specific to the product.</li>
  <li>Testing the parameters of the problem.</li>
  <li>Testing the practical application of alternative problem solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once potential solutions are identified, the selection process is underpinned by rationality. Designers are encouraged to analyze and falsify these solutions to arrive at the best available option for each identified problem or obstacle during the design process phases.</p>
